# MemoryManager
Memory Manager for COM 310 to simulate how a computer's memory is managed.

## Limitations
1. Currently, there is a maximum of 10 processes that can be in memory at a given time.
2. The only functional algorithms thus far is First Fit and Worst Fit.
3. Once a process has been added, total size can not be altered. In order to change the size, the page must be refreshed.
